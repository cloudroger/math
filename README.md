I don't have a math degree. I don't have a physics degree. What I do have, like many others, is a willingness to think openly. To reason without assumption.

If you are someone who believes that the [gatekeeping system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review) is a singular and infallible method of selecting which ideas receive a seat at the table, I have one question for you: 

Are you willing to give up 1 minute and 37 seconds of your time with a fully open mindset? https://youtu.be/qkXZ3_ZmKzw

Let's pretend there is a planet, far away, like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b), where there is a civilization of one million primitive beings figuring out what *we assume* to be basic math.

If 999,000 of these beings agree that 1 + 1 = 3, and this majority ridicules the 1000 "fools" who believe that 1 + 1 = 2;
Who are the real fools of this civilization? the 999,000...or the 1000?

Now you might say, "this is a silly pretend scenario because ***obviously*** 1 + 1 = 2, so ***we*** here on earth would never be dumb enough to miss that.

Ask yourself, have you ***ever*** believed something with certainty, but then later changed your mind on it? I know ***my*** answer to this.

We (humans) have even accepted [mathematical proofs that were later ***disproven***](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-to-be-wrong)
___
Nothing is infalliby provable, therefore conceptual certainty cannot exist. [Kurt GÃ¶del pointed this out](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-incompleteness-theorems-work-20200714/)
___
So, question everything.
