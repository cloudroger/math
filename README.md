I don't have a math degree. I don't have a physics degree. What I do have, like many others, is a willingness to think openly. To reason without assumption.

If you are someone who believes that the [gatekeeping system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review) is a singular and infallible method of selecting which ideas receive a seat at the table, I have one question for you: 

Are you willing to give up 1 minute and 37 seconds of your time with a fully open mindset? https://youtu.be/qkXZ3_ZmKzw



Let's pretend there is a planet, far away, like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri), where there is a civilization of one million primitive beings figuring out what we know as basic math.

If 999,000 of these beings agree that 1 + 1 = 3, and this majority ridicules the 1000 "fools" who believe that 1 + 1 = 2;
Who are the real fools of this civilization, the 999,000...or the 1000?
