    "Note: *I use the term Hyperfactorial differently than used by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfactorial) and [wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hyperfactorial.html). These sources use the term to describe what I am describing here as exactly (and only) the exponential factorial. I am using the term to describe a variable hyperdegree of factorial based on the hyperoperation, e.g. Addition? Multiplication? Exponentiation? Tetration?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The thought is that $Triangular < Factorial < Exponential Factorial < Tetrative Factorial <....H_{n} Factorial$ lies on the same sort of hypersequence of succession. The language here might be confusing because of legacy naming conventions, but the $Triangular$ could be called the factorial on the additive hyperlevel. And what is normally called the $Factorial$ could be specified as the factorial on the multiplicative level, so both will be represented as such here. \n",

    "Additionally, I feel it is necessary to insert hyperfactorials for the two preceding hyperoperations to the beginning of this sequence; incrementation, $a+1$ and, what I will call ***Negation*** as this hyperoperation does not seem to be defined elsewhere. [Depending on whether a one vector or two vector number system](https://github.com/cloudroger/one_vector_numbers/blob/main/single_vector_wp.ipynb) is used, the negation sequence will be different. If it is the traditional two vector, it will be $a-b$. If it is a one vector system, it will be $a / b$. So I have included the sequences for both types.\n",
